How much information can you recover by decrypting the!corrupted file, if the encryption mode is ECB, CBC, or OFB,respectively? Please provide a justification for each of them. (When you do this task, try to answer this question before you conduct this task, and then find out whether your answeris correct or wrong after you finish this task.). For each encryption mode, you need to show the result you obtained when decrypting the
corrupted ciphertext (you can print the results from the command line, or save them to external files, and then take the necessary screenshots) in your Lab report. Most of the encryption modes require an initial vector (IV) orinitialrandom value (r). Properties of an IV depend on the cryptographic scheme used. If we are not careful in selecting IVs, the data encrypted by us may not be secure at all, even though we are using a secure encryption algorithm and mode. The objective of this task is to understand the problems if an IV is not selected properly. Please do the following experiments:
